**Phi** - Haskell-style functional programming language running on Erlang VM.

**Phi** is a strongly-typed language with compile-time type-checking and built-in support for concurrency and distribution.

**Phi** empowers industries to build the next generation of scalable, reliable, real-time applications, especially for 5G, IoT, and edge computing.
